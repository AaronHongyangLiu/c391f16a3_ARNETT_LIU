Question 8:
    - the program assumes RDF input data where each object is on a new line, and if there are multiple predicates separated
        by ';', then the new predicate is also on a new line. The example Edmonton.txt file is an example of this.
    - the program also assumes that the subject, predicate and object are tab separated



Question 9:
    - assume that the SELECT and ?var will be in the same line
    - assume there is no || or &&
